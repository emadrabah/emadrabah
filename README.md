I design and build production-grade software systems for industrial and critical environments, with a focus on scalable telemetry, edge gateways, and secure backend platforms. My work spans from low-level device communication to cloud-ready ingestion and monitoring solutions.

### Areas of Expertise
- Industrial telemetry & monitoring systems  
- Edge gateways (RS-485, Modbus, MQTT)  
- Backend platforms (Python, FastAPI)  
- Time-series data & analytics (PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB)  
- Scalable ingestion pipelines  
- Authentication & identity (SSO, SAML, Keycloak)  
- Linux, Docker, and production deployments

### Selected Systems

#### Campion CathView System
An end-to-end industrial monitoring platform designed for reliable operation in production environments. The system is built with clear separation between edge collection, ingestion, and visualization layers to support scalability and long-term maintainability.

**Core Components**
- **CathView Gateway**  
  On-site edge gateway responsible for collecting telemetry from industrial devices using protocols such as Modbus over RS-485, performing validation and buffering, and securely publishing data upstream.

- **CathView Ingest**  
  A scalable backend ingestion service that receives high-volume telemetry from distributed gateways over MQTT, validates and processes messages, and efficiently persists time-series data for analytics and monitoring.

- **CathView Web**  
  A web-based monitoring and management application providing dashboards, device visibility, and system administration for operators and engineers.

The Campion CathView System is designed to support large deployments with thousands of devices and gateways, while maintaining reliability, data integrity, and operational clarity.

### Technology Stack
- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs  
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB  
- **Messaging:** MQTT  
- **Frontend:** Modern web stack (Vite, TypeScript)  
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Linux (Ubuntu Server)

### Professional Approach
I focus on clean architecture, clear system boundaries, and practical engineering decisions that work in real-world industrial environments. Most of my production work is maintained in private repositories, while public materials here reflect system design, structure, and engineering philosophy rather than proprietary code.
